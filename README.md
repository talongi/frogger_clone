This is clone of the classic game, Frogger. The game engine.js and resources.js files came from a Udacity course on Object Oriented Javascript.

To launch the game, open the index.html file in your browser.

Use the keyboard arrow keys to move the character, avoid the bugs, and reach the water. Your score goes up by 10 points when you reach the water, but goes down by 10 points when you are hit by a bug.
